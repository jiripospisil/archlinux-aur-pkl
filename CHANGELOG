Changes in version 0.26.3 (2024-08-06)

  Fixes:
    - Fixes an issue where CLI argument --property foo="" is effectively parsed
      as --property foo="true". This is now parsed as an empty string (#596).

    - Fixes a regression where amending a globbed import or globbed read results
      in a PklBugException (#607).

    - Fixes an issue around using file() notation when using the pkl-gradle
      plugin on Windows (#611).


Changes in version 0.26.2 (2024-07-18)

  Fixes:
    - Fixes a possible race condition where multiple concurrent Pkl evaluations
      results in a thrown exception when downloading packages (#584).


Changes in version 0.26.1 (2024-06-28)

  Fixes:
    - Fixes a regression where native executables fail to run on some
      environments that don’t support newer CPU features (#551).

    - Fixes a PklBugException when passing . as a project directory to pkl
      project resolve and pkl project package (#544).

  Changes:
    - Disable revocation checking of TLS certificates (#553).

    - As part of HTTP improvements in 0.26, we unwittingly fixed a bug where Pkl
      does not actually perform cert revocation checks when making HTTPS
      requests. This fix, unfortunately, caused a regression in some cases. For
      example, this happens when connecting to a server that bears a public
      trust certificate, while in an environment with no internet access. This
      is because the HTTP client needs to check the revocation status of all
      certificates in the chain.

      Revocation checks are a nuanced topic with some benefits, and also with its
      own problem areas. For this reason, revocation checking is disabled for
      Pkl’s native CLIs. Users of Pkl’s Java APIs will respect the revocation
      settings set in the JVM.


Changes in version 0.26.0 (2024-06-17)

  This release brings Windows support, improvements to controlling how Pkl talks
  over HTTP, and also fixes a scoping bug around typealiases.
